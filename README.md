# Theme Toggler

This is a simple web application that demonstrates dynamic theme toggling. Users can switch between light, dark, and solarized themes with smooth transitions. The theme preference is saved to the local storage, enabling persistence across browser sessions.

## Features

- Light, Dark, and Solarized theme modes.
- Persistent theme settings using local storage.
- Modern, minimalist design with Montserrat font.
- Responsive navigation bar suitable for both desktop and mobile.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/titasbartulis/css-theme-toggler.git

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the project in action.

## How It Works

The application uses vanilla JavaScript to switch between themes. Click on the 'Theme' dropdown in the navigation bar to select a theme. The selection triggers a JavaScript function that changes the page's CSS variables and saves the choice to local storage.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML document with structural content.
- `style.css` - Stylesheet with theme-related styles and animations.
- `app.js` - JavaScript file handling the theme-switching logic.
